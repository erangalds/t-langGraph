    "## What if I want to move my graph flow from a node to another node based on a *condition*\n",
    "Now the question I have is, what I want to connect nodes in such a way that, the node flow will continue based on a certain condition (a decision). Can we do that in *LangGraph*. I am curious. Let's explore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me think of a scenario. Lets say, I want a graph which is a very basic calculator. A very basic calcultor, which means it can only add or subtract. Even that it can do for only two numbers. That's all. So the expected flow is as follows. \n",
    "+ You as the name of the user\n",
    "+ Ask for the operation I need to carry out. In this case either \"add\" or \"subtract\"\n",
    "+ Then ask for the two numbers (number1 and number2)\n",
    "+ Carry on with the operation and give the final answer, with a personalized response. \n",
    "\n",
    "This usecase, I can try to implement it in two ways to make it more engaging. \n",
    "+ #1: I give all the needed input at the time the *graph* is *invoked*\n",
    "+ #2: I ask for information while the *graph* is running\n",
    "\n",
    "In either of the way, there is a very interesting thing I need to clarify. Which is can we pass the process flow to nodes based on a condition. In this case, if the operation is addition, the flow to pass down to the *addition_node* otherwise to the *subtract_node*. Let's me findout. \n",
    "\n",
    "what I found was, that we can make use of a special type of *edge* called *conditional_edge* in *langgraph* to accomplish this. Just like we use a python function to define the *action* of a *graph node*, we need to define a python function to define how the decision is taken in the *conditional edge*. Therefore we need an extra function to define the conditional edge behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to start with the #1 way. Let me first define the steps. \n",
    "+ import the modules\n",
    "+ Define the *Graph State* variable\n",
    "+ Define the *node functions*. \n",
    "    + `decision_node`: node which decides which node to pass the processing to. \n",
    "    + `addition_node`: node which does the addition part\n",
    "    + `subtraction_node`: node which does the subtracting part\n",
    "+ Define the conditional edge function\n",
    "+ setup the entry point and finish points. \n",
    "+ Visualize the graph\n",
    "+ Define an input\n",
    "+ invoke the graph. \n"
