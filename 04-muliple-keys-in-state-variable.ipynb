    "## Adding Multiple keys and values into the *State* \n",
    "Well during the previous couple of experement I clarified below points about *LangGraph*. \n",
    "+ I can create a *graph* structure creating an instance of *LangGraph StateGraph* class. \n",
    "+ I can add *nodes* into the graph. \n",
    "+ Each *node* requires two things, a *name* for the *node* and an *action*, which defines what's that *node* is supposed to do when that *node* is called. \n",
    "    + *name* I can specify as a string \"greeting_node\"\n",
    "    + *action* The best practise is to define a python function as we normally define with `def` and take that function as the *action* of the *node*\n",
    "+ I needed to set the starting place (node) of the *graph* by setting the *entry_point* and similarly I had to set the finishing place (node) by setting *finish_point*\n",
    "+ The `StateGraph` instance requires an input which is named *Graph State* variable. The best practice is to define a *Graph State* variable with *python type hinting* as a `TypedDict` dictionary object. \n",
    "+ Each node requires to accept an input, and that input is the *Graph State*. \n",
    "+ I can add multiple nodes into the *graph*.\n",
    "+ Once I add multiple nodes into the *graph* I need to connect the *nodes* with each other using *edges*\n",
    "+ We can make changes to the *Graph State* variable and pass it to the next nodes by *returning* that *Graph State* variable at the end of each *node function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Graph State* variable I have tried so far was a very simple dictionary which had only one *key*. What if I wanted to add multiple *keys* in the *Graph State*. How can I do that? Let's try to clarify all those questions now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me define a simple graph with one *node* but multiple *keys* in the *Graph State*. \n",
